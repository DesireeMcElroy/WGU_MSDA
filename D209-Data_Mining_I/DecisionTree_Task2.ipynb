    "Similarly to the project from Task 1 using Naive Bayes, I would like to explore once again whether  there could be any contributing factors in someone being diagnosed with diabetes? Could these features be solid predictors in identifying who is more at risk for diabetes? \n",

    "As highlighted in my previous analysis using Naive Bayes, diabetes is a prevalent disease affecting millions of Americans and continues to pose a significant public health challenge. In my last project, it was revealed that Naive Bayes was not a good predictor of diabetes. It is known that characteristics such as a person's demographics, location, and lifestyle choices are often linked to diabetes risk. I want to challenge this data set again, employing decision tree methods to help identify the most important predictors of diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying the Decision Tree algorithm to this data set, I aim to uncover the underlying patterns and relationships that contribute to the development of diabetes.  Decision Trees are adept at capturing complex, non-linear feature interactions, I hope to gain valuable insights into the factors influencing diabetes and can uncover patterns in the data not originally noticed."

    "\n",
    "Unlike Naive Bayes or other linear models, Decision Trees generally make no assumptions about the data's distribution or multi-collinearity. This is ideal as the previous exploration project from D207 Data Exploration revealed no existing linear relationships between features or target variables. Only a handful of variables (doc_visits and vitd_levels) actually projected a normal distribution.\n",

    "## B3.  Python Packages & Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has many versatile libraries, including NumPy (for numerical operations) and Pandas (for manipulating dataframes), which are particularly useful in preparing data for decision tree algorithms. During the data wrangling phase, Pandas proves invaluable for cleaning, transforming, and creating new features necessary for decision tree models. Functions such as filling null values, changing data types, and one-hot encoding categorical variables are critical when preparing data for the branching structure of decision trees. NumPy enhances performance with useful numerical operations on arrays, which is especially handy when computing splits based on various criteria in decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scikit-learn (sklearn) library is a powerful tool for building decision tree models, providing tools for cross-validation, feature importance analysis, and model optimization, all of which are critical for fine-tuning decision trees to improve their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn provide visually appealing and insightful representations for tasks like feature reduction, feature performance analysis, and distribution plots. These quick, intuitive visuals are helpful during data preprocessing, making it easier to identify trends, outliers, and relationships in the data, all of which are crucial for refining models. \n",

    "In summary, these libraries—Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn—are essential for handling data and building efficient decision tree models, thanks to their ease of use, powerful functionalities, and strong community support."

    "\n",
    "Data pre-processing is an essential step in preparing a data set for use with decision trees. It ensures the model can accurately learn from and make informed decisions from the data. Despite decision trees being less sensitive to certain types of data disparities compared to other algorithms (e.g. missing values, categorical data), proper preparation can significantly improve their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "When preparing data for decision tree algorithms, one important pre-processing step is one-hot encoding. Although decision trees can handle categorical data directly, using one hot encoding can still help improve interpretability and aid in consistency. One-hot encoding converts categorical variables into numerical format by creating new binary columns for each category. For example, with the \"gender\" column that has values like female, male, and nonbinary, one-hot encoding will create two new columns: one for male and one for nonbinary (dropping female to avoid redundancy). As a result, each category is represented numerically as either 1 (present) or 0 (absent), helping the decision tree algorithm use this data effectively during training."
