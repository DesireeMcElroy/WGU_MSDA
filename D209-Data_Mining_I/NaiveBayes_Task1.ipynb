    "\n",
    " According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), diabetes affects more than 38 million Americans. This disease remains a serious illness among population. By exploring this data set using Naive Bayes methods, I may be able to uncover what underlying patterns and correlations that may be contributing to this disease. Demographics, location and lifestyle features are known to be associated with the risk of diabetes.\n",
    "By incorporating these variables into a Naive Bayes model, I can predict the likelihood of diabetes and identify which factors are most strongly associated with a diagnosis. Naive Bayes is effective for this because it assumes feature independence, allowing it to efficiently model the contributions of each factor. In summary, my main goal is to identify what importance each feature may have in relation to diabetes."

    "## B1.  Naive Bayes Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is an effective algorithm for classifying features in predicting target variables like diabetes due to its simplicity, speed, and ability to handle high dimensional data. The algorithm's different functions, such as Gaussian Naive Bayes (handling continuous variables like age) and Bernoulli Naive Bayes (suitable for binary and categorical features) make it adaptable to datasets with a variety of data types. This flexibility makes it ideal for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes can still perform well even when its assumption of feature independence is violated. Additionally, while Naive Bayes does not necessarily address imbalanced data, it can handle imbalanced datasets well due to the probabilistic nature of its predictions. This is vital for features like gender that contains severe class imbalances.\n",
    "\n",
    "While dimensionality isnâ€™t a major concern in the dataset (lacking high cardinality), Naive Bayes performs well in high-dimensional spaces, particularly in text classification tasks. Lastly, Naive Bayes is computationally efficient, making it suitable for faster predictions, which can be beneficial for larger healthcare systems and real life applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the nature of the dataset, Naive Bayes is expected to perform well in identifying contributing factors for diabetes, such as age, area, and medical conditions (e.g. overweight). The model will provide probabilistic outputs, allowing the estimation of the likelihood of a patient being diagnosed with diabetes based on the features."

    "## B2.  Summarize one assumption of the chosen classification method.\n",
    "One of the main reasons Naive Bayes received its name ***naive*** is because of an assumption that all feature variables are completely independent of one another. It naively assumes the \"presence or absence of a particular feature does not affect the presence or absence of any other feature\" (Spot Intelligence 2024). Despite this assumption often being violated due to its unrealistic nature, this algorithm still performs fairly well in practice."

    "\n",
    "Python has many versatile libraries including NumPy (numerical python operations) and Pandas (used for manipulation of dataframes). During the wrangling phase, the pandas library proves to be incredibly useful for the manipulation of dataframes, including cleaning, transforming and creating new features. It has many useful functions needed to help prepare dataframes for modeling such as functions to fill nulls, change data types, and one hot encode variables. Numpy is also a favorite with it's powerful performance with numerical operations on arrays. This is especially useful for preparing data for machine learning models like Naive Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn (sklearn) is a great library for machine learning because it provides a wide range of efficient tools for model building, data preprocessing, and evaluation. It offers user friendly functions for classification tasks. Additionally, its integration with NumPy and Pandas makes data manipulation easily achievable, and it supports techniques such as cross validation and model fine tuning.\n",

    "While data in general requires many preprocessing steps to prepare for machine learning, one of the most important ones is one hot encoding. Models such as Naive Bayes require numerical data. When working with tabular data, any non numerical variables must be converted to numerical representation. One hot encoding is an especially useful function in converting categorical variables into readable numerical columns. Each value in the specific column will be transformed into a *flag* column (binary 1/0). For example, gender has the three values: female, male and nonbinary. In order for this to be translated numerically, each value will be transformed into its own flag column, often dropping the first column to avoid repetitiveness. In turn the results will be two binary columns representing `male` and `nonbinary`. Both columns having 0 as a value mathematically represents the female gender."
