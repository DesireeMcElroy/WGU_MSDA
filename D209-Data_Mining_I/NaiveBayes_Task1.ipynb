    " According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), diabetes affects more than 38 million Americans. This disease remains a serious illness among population. By exploring this data set using Naive Bayes methods, I may be able to uncover what underlying patterns and correlations that may be contributing to this disease. Demographics, location and lifestyle features are known to be associated with the risk of diabetes.\n",
    "By incorporating these variables into a Naive Bayes model, I can predict the likelihood of diabetes and identify which factors are most strongly associated with a diagnosis. Naive Bayes is effective for this because it assumes feature independence, allowing it to efficiently model the contributions of each factor. In summary, my main goal is to identify what importance each feature may have in relation to diabetes."
