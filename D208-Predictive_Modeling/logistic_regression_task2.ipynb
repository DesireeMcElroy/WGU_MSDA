    "The goals of this data analysis are essentially to uncover what factors influence whether a patient is re-admitted within 30 days of release. By examining the data, we aim to uncover key relationships between patients who are readmitted and those who are not. This analysis could help us identify which demographics are more prone to readmission, as well as geographical areas and hospital stay events that may impact the likelihood of a patient returning within 30 days. The insights gathered could provide valuable understanding for improving patient care and reducing readmission rates."
