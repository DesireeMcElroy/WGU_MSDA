    "The goal of the data analysis is to discover which factors influence a patient's length of stay. By uncovering which variables are correlated, whether it be patient demographics, hospital procedures or similar details, medical hospitals can utilize these findings in multiple different way such as improving patient care through better practices. Examples of improving patient care include identifying the higher risk patients (those likely to have longer stays) to possibly come up with more targeted interventions and preventative care measures. As a result of the previously mentioned benefit, hospital resources may be more optimally allocated, resulting in quick patient turnover and reduced overall medical costs for both patients and medical centers.\n"

    "Multiple linear regression relies on four main assumptions. These four assumptions are linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity is defined as an existing linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Any change applied to an independent variable will effect the dependent variable linearly. A simpler way to explain this is an existing \"straight line relationship between two variables\" (Investopedia Linear Relationship Definition, Formula, and Examples).\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence is defined as the residuals being independent. Residuals are also known as the error, which is the difference between a predicted value and actual value $(y-\\hat{y})$. Independence among residuals implies there is no correlation between residuals. In summary, the residuals are ***normally distributed***.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore on the subject of residuals, Homoscedasticity is defined as the variance of residuals remaining constant across all independent values. A good visual would be visualizing a scatterplot with the regression line and plotted residuals. In the case of homoscedascticity, the residuals should have similar variance from their respective predicted values. In contrast, heterosceascticity would not have a constant variance among the residuals, resulting in patterns such as cone-shapes, u-shapes, etc.. (Homoscedasticity - Statistics Solutions)\n"
